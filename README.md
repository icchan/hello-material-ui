# This is my first Material UI React application

## The idea behind the example

<!-- #host-reference -->

This example demonstrates how you can use Material UI with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) in [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript).
It includes `@mui/material` and its peer dependencies, including [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction), the default style engine in Material UI.
If you prefer, you can [use styled-components instead](https://mui.com/material-ui/integrations/interoperability/#styled-components).


## Why?

I am using this hello world to demonstrate how to use Azure OpenAI to review a pull request.

## Getting started
The quick way to get started is to 
1. copy the `.github/workflows/code-review.yml`
1. create an environment in your github settings named `OpenAI_Intelligent_DevOps`
1. populate `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` and `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` in that enviroment's secrets
1. create a pull request
1. wait for the review to be completed
1. check the review comments
